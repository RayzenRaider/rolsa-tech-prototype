Instructions for students
You must complete ALL activities within the assessment.
Your centre will schedule 30 supervised hours during the three=week window in which you produce the outcomes for this task.

During this task, you are allowed:
- monitored access to the internet
- access to a copy of your proposal and designs produced in Task 1
You are not allowed to make changes to the evidence provided in Task 1.
Your work will be kept securely during any breaks and between scheduled sessions.
Templates provided for use during this task:
- Task2_Test_Log_Template.doc

During this task, your tutor is permitted to provide general feedback about:
- the appropriateness of the solution you designed in Task 1
- whether the solution you are developing will function as intended
Your tutor is not permitted to provide guidance on how to improve your solution.


Set Task Brief
You work for a software development company. The company has secured a contract to develop a solution for a local green technology company, Rolsa Technologies. Rolsa Technologies specialises in:
- solar panel installation and maintenance.
- electric vehicle (EV) charging stations.
- smart home energy management systems.

The clients (owners of Rolsa Technologies) would like to develop a digital solution that will:
- provide customers with information about:
	- green energy products currently on the market.
	- how to reduce their carbon footprint.
- allow customers to:
	- schedule consultations and installations.
	- calculate their carbon footprint.

The client has conducted market research with existing customers to identify features that could be included in the digital solution. These suggested features by the client are:
- account registration to allow customers to manage their consultations and data.
- accessibility features to support a wide range of users.
- a tool for calculating and tracking energy usage.


Activity
Developing the prototype
Develop a functional prototype of your proposed digital solution to meet the client's needs.
During development, make sure you:
- implement secure code in at least two appropriate languages to implement front-end and back-end processes
- gather and prepare appropriate assets to be used in the development of your digital solution
- make use of, and document, iterative testing
- document the iterative development process, including changes made to the solution during development
- produce a code that can be maintained by a third party
- ensure a high-quality user experience
- follow legal and regulatory guidelines and standards
When gathering assets, you need to record the sources you use in an assets log.
Your log must:
- record all the sources you have used
- describe the content and its intended purpose
- log the date on which you retrieved the information
Your testing documentation does not need to include details of every test carried out. However, it should demonstrate:
- an iterative approach to testing
- understanding of how to test inputs, calculations, validation and processes using appropriate test data
